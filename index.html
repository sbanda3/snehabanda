                displays the current UV index level. Based on the UV index, the app offers personalized advice and recommendations for sun protection measures. This advice can include suggestions for 
                sunscreen application, protective clothing, sunglasses, and other precautions to help users minimize their exposure to harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The app is a valuable tool for
